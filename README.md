# py-api
Short projects using APIs. 
quickWeather.py is a program to test my first API with in Python. I am using the OpenWeather API to receive current weather results.
This includes current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, as well as the expected low and high of the given location. 
This program requires the user to enter a location from the command line which corresponds with the API location information. Please consult the OpenWeather API if searching for a specific location. 
Example: quickWeather.py Cincinnati, US. Enter this into the command line will return weather information for Cincinnati, OH.
